# Sam Hiken

##### Bio

Hi! My name is Sam Hiken. I am currently a pre-doctoral researcher in the Theory of Computing group at MIT, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Virginia Vassilevska Williams. I am generously funded by the Paglia Post-Baccalaureate Fellowship.

Before this, I did my undergrad at Carleton College, where I majored in math and computer science. During the summer of 2022, I participated in the DIMACS REU, where I was advised by Nicole Wein.
